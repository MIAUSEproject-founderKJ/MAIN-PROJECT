The MIAUSE (Mechanical Inclusive Automatic Upgradable Symbiotic Ecosystem) project and its associated principles, goals, and mechanisms aim to create a harmonious coexistence between humans and machines in the workplace while ensuring increased well-being and productivity. To successfully implement MIAUSE, here's a summary of key points and actions:

Visions & Goals:

The primary goal is to allow humans to reach their potential for happiness, skill development, and harmonious relationships by automating many labor-intensive tasks.
Simultaneously, the project aims to ensure sufficient production to meet human needs, breaking the cycle of excessive work and rising living costs.
Principles of MIAUSE:

Symbiotic: Bots work alongside humans rather than replacing them. The combined productivity of humans and bots should remain the same as if only one worked, preventing exploitation.
Inclusive: MIAUSE should be accessible to employees from all social classes, ensuring equitable opportunities.
Upgradable & Automatic: Bots must self-repair and upgrade, minimizing human intervention. They should be able to work with minimal supervision.
Non-Humanoid Shape: The form of the machines is not restricted to a human-like shape, promoting diversity in design.
Reasons to Purchase:

The product's AI capabilities offer stable and enhanced productivity.
Bots reduce risks associated with human labor, like injuries and emergency leaves.
MIAUSE breaks the cycle of excessive work, enabling humans to spend time on more fulfilling activities.
It encourages the pursuit of less-profitable but valuable tasks, such as farming, plantation, and intellectual pursuits, by automating routine work.
Descriptions:

MIAUSE is a machine/bot-based system utilizing Robotic Process Automation.
It integrates a self-circulating virtual economy system that synchronizes the credit of machines/bots with specific individuals.
Credits are only recognized when a person is engaged in productive activities; slacking off is detected.
Recognized credits earned by machines are convertible to salary.
Implementations Needed:

Machines require capabilities for input/output of information, self-maintenance, manufacturing, logistics, energy management, storage/space occupancy, and legal/regulatory compliance.
Integration with real economic activities is vital for MIAUSE's success.
Ensuring the behavior of the "Buddy" (the person represented by the machine) is consistent with MIAUSE principles.
Ensuring the purchase of MIAUSE products by employers and employees.
Economy:

The existence of the machine should be closely tied to the represented human.
Both employers and employees should gain profits from using MIAUSE products.
Ethics & Regulations:

Prevent unemployment by ensuring that bots complement, rather than replace, human workers.
Avoid the misuse of MIAUSE products for slacking off.
Disallow the abuse of MIAUSE by authorities and companies.
In summary, the MIAUSE project strives to create a balanced, symbiotic relationship between humans and machines in the workplace. This is achieved by implementing principles that promote inclusivity, automation, and ethical practices, ultimately improving well-being and productivity for all. It also emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior and regulatory measures to ensure its goals are met.
