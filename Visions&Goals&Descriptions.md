"Mechanical Inclusive Automatic Upgradable Symbiotic Ecosystem" 

title 01 : Visions & Goals
This project aims to allow and encourage human to have time to reach their own divinity, ultimate happiness or at least develop skills or harmonic relationship with people around while ensure that the production such as farming, manufacturing... to be sufficient to supply us, by letting the machine to do many of the workload on behalf of every human, thus increase the free time for human to explore and find ultimate happiness, spend time with family or friends, develop skills or think.

title 02 : Present & Future
The decreasing of population gain in nowadays is actually bad for the economy, but the pursue of financial growth of the companies and authorities that causes rising in living costs, has been bringing difficulties of people in every aspects including children nursery, causing decreasing in the gain of population, thus causing spiralling detrimental loop as the population of customers will decrease. Hence, hopefully, by introducing this ecosystem, growth of human and harmony of society will be ensured by allowing the people able to spend time for ownselves.

Now, we can see the future of auto-driving, which requires minimal manual interference. This shows that it is not impossible to develop MIAUSE that able to do work on behalf of someone. However, it is important that interaction through working is necessary in order to develop connections and communications with other people, preventing us from too indulged in our own safe zone.

title 03 : Principles of MIAUSE
1) Symbiotic- where every single machine/bot is doing work on behalf of certain existing working people. In addition, extra production due to the increase in manpower (machine/bot) will not be recognized in order to ensure human is not driven to do extra work.
2) Inclusive- The product must be inclusive to employees from all classes.
3) Upgradable-The product shall be able to upgrade themselves to optimize their production.
4) Automatic - where the product shall able to self-repair, upgrade and do work with minimal supervision
5) forms and shapes of machines shall not must be human-like shape

title 04 : Descriptions
1) build a machine/bot-based system with Robotic process automation 
2) which integrates self-circle virtual economy system that synchronize the credit of the machine/bot with the certain person
3) The credit only will be recognizable when the represented person is doing productive activities like cooking, planting, spending time with family or friends, developing skills, mediating, thinking or resting during time the bots is doing jobs. Which means slacking off will be detected and the credits earned by the bot will not be usable.
4) The recognized credits earned by the machine shall be convertible to salary
5) Since the person is being represented by the machine, the 

title 05 : Implementations needed
1) MACHINES
   1) INPUT OUTPUT OF INFORMATION
   2) SELF-MAINTENANCE
   3) MANUFACTURING SITES
   4) LOGISTIC
   6) ENERGY
   7) STORAGE/SPACE OCCUPANCY
   8) LAW AND REGULATION
   9) INTEGRATION WITH REAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
   10) ENSURE OF BEHAVIOUR OF "BUDDY" (person who is represented by the machine)
   11) ENSURE THE PURCHASE OF THE PRODUCTS
   

2) ECONOMY
   1) NECESSARY TO BIND THE EXISTENCE OF THE MACHINE WITH THE REPPRESENTED HUMAN
  
   2)
